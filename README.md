## Development

Get [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), then:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:developmentseed/stac-map
cd stac-map
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will open a development server at <http://localhost:5173/stac-map/>.

We have some code quality checks:

```shell
yarn lint
yarn format
```

And some simple tests:

```shell
yarn playwright install
yarn test
```

## Contributing

We have some [architecture documentation](./docs/architecture.md) to help you get the lay of the land.
We use Github [Pull Requests](https://github.com/developmentseed/stac-map/pulls) to propose changes, and [Issues](https://github.com/developmentseed/stac-map/issues) to report bugs and request features.

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release?tab=readme-ov-file) to create [releases](https://github.com/developmentseed/stac-map/releases).
This requires our commit messages to conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Deploying

See [deploy.yaml](./.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) for a (drop-dead simple) example of deploying this application as a static site via Github Pages.

### White-label deployment

You can deploy your own customized version of stac-map using environment variables:

| Variable            | Description                        | Default            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `VITE_BASE_PATH`    | URL path prefix (e.g., `/my-app/`) | `/stac-map/`       |
| `VITE_DEFAULT_HREF` | STAC resource to load on startup   | None (shows intro) |

Example:

```shell
VITE_BASE_PATH=/ VITE_DEFAULT_HREF=https://my-stac-api.com yarn build
```

Or create a `.env` file:

```shell
VITE_BASE_PATH=/
VITE_DEFAULT_HREF=https://my-stac-api.com
```

Then run `yarn build` and deploy the `dist/` directory to your static hosting provider.
For an example of white-labeling **stac-map**, see https://github.com/gadomski/eoapi.stac-map.io.
